               I’m a passionate Computer Science student at FAST NUCES with a drive for crafting digital products that solve real problems. My journey started with a curiosity for logic and C programming, and it has quickly evolved into a focus on modern web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, building everything from student utility applications to online election systems. My approach combines strong programming fundamentals with a creative eye for design, leveraging tools like Canva to ensure the user interface is as sharp as the code behind it.
              </p>
              <p>
               When I'm not coding, you'll find me sharpening my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, diving into Object-Oriented Programming, or collaborating with teammates to build impactful projects.
